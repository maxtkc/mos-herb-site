This is a legal document and you should read it carefully.

When the first letter of a word is capitalized in this document, it has
a special and specific meaning. We call those words “Defined Terms,” because
we’re going to give you a definition of what each term means as used in this
document.

When you see a plural or a plural possessive pronoun, such as “We” and “Our,”
that refers to the Company.
