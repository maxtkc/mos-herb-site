Mo believes in the inherent capacity of bodies to heal, and uses plants to help
support that capacity. They know what it’s like to feel at the end of your rope
with the healthcare system, and also what it’s like to find healing beyond that
place. They want to help you connect to the knowledge that you already have
about your body and herbs through exploring your ancestral traditions,
community networks, and gardens and kitchens — especially if you don’t believe
you have this knowledge!

Mo is a queer Ashkenazi Jew who grew up tending and harvesting roadside fruit
with their family in Boston. They currently work and live at Haley House, on
unceded Massachusett tribal lands, where they lead the preparation of
nourishing and delicious meals for unhoused neighbors and coordinate the
distribution of hundreds of bags of groceries to Chinese neighbors. Stop by
during soup kitchen hours and you might find them cooking hundreds of latkes in
the soup kitchen or learning Cantonese from an elderly friend!

Mo is especially interested in supporting anyone, including elders,
neurodivergent and queer folks, who has felt marginalized by their healthcare
professionals.
