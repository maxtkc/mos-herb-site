Hi there! I’m Mo, a Boston area clinical herbalist and community educator. I work with clients in person in **Davis Square, Somerville and virtually** worldwide. We use plants to **address the root imbalances** that are causing dysregulation in order to build **long-term healing**, focusing on gut health.

I also teach community classes all over -- contact me if you’d like me to teach for your local organization!

### Why gut health?
The gut is an ecosystem. We are living through deep ecosystem dysregulation on a global scale. Naturally, impacts ripple across the smaller ecosystems within our own bodies. Trauma shows up in many places in the body, and **I work with clients whose trauma is showing up specifically in the gut** to move, heal, and regulate so that we can show up fully embodied for our work in this world.

**One reason I love the gut is its capacity for change.** The epithelial cells lining the small intestine are fully replaced every 3-5 days! We can use herbs as topical remedies on our internal “skin” to affect changes even with compounds we can’t absorb into our bloodstream. Thus, tea is essentially a gut bath!

### Philosophy
![](/assets/images/webp/hhfarm.webp){: style="float: left; width: 50%"}
I work with what is showing up for those who come to my practice. There is no “one size fits all” approach with herbs! **You lead the way by sharing about your own concerns, experiences, and hopes around your health**, and **we work together** to uncover what is at the root of the symptoms you’re experiencing. I am here to educate and provide a framework -- you are in charge of your body -- and we collaborate to help you meet your goals.

### Background
I am a queer Ashkenazi Jew who grew up tending and harvesting roadside fruit trees and arbors with my family in Boston, on Massachusett and Pawtucket land. I have been working with plants and people since childhood and am so grateful for this early connection to food and community. I love to swim in the ocean (shoutout to Revere Beach!), pick juneberries, and share food with my beloveds.

### Education
I spent three years (1300+ hours) studying herbalism in-depth at the [Vermont Center for Integrative Herbalism](https://vtherbcenter.org/). In my final year I worked in the sliding-scale student clinic, where I saw dozens of clients and received support from my colleagues and teachers. I feel so fortunate to have learned from many brilliant teachers including Betzy Bancroft, Larken Bunce, Linden de Voil, Kristin Henningsen, Guido Masé, Ember Peters, and others, each bringing unique strengths and perspectives. I continue to learn from the plants and from my colleagues, students, and mentors  — and from my garden and kitchen!
