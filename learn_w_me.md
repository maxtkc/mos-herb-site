##### Herb of the Month Series 

> May 28, June 4, July 9 2023, 4-5:30pm, Somerville Community Growing Center

Come spend the afternoon getting deeply acquainted with one medicinal plant
each month! We’ll spend time getting to know each plant through drawing, taste,
science, and stories of herbalists’ experience. Bring your journal and leave
with an in-depth account of botany, history, clinical use, safety, preparation
and dosage, and much much more.

Come each month to build your materia medica or just once to meet a new plant
friend!

##### Taste the Molecular Rainbow: What Color and Flavor Tell Us About Chemistry

> September 10 2023, 4-5:30pm, Somerville Community Growing Center

Why do all alliums have that strong garlicky smell? How do I know if the dried
herbs I've had in my cabinet for five years are still good? In this class you
will begin to practice using your senses to teach you about the chemical
constituents in your foods and medicine. We will discuss the primary atoms that
make up plant molecules, and some common forms that they take. You will get to
see, smell, and taste different preparations of the same herbs to learn the
flavors and mouthfeel of specific molecules, and to learn which preparations
extract which constituents. Bring your favorite mug and a pen and come join me
where experiential and scientific knowledge meet!
