I offer grape pruning for home arbors in the Boston area! Grape pruning happens January-March, but now is a great time to [get on my list](https://mokatzchristy.com/contact.html) for 2025.\
\
Grape arbors provide food (+ drink!), shade, and beauty. But they grow like crazy and can be a nuisance to maintain! Pruning removes dead branches, reduces mold, and allows grapes to form in neat bunches for easy harvest. No arbor is too overgrown or too tidy!

**Do you prune other fruit trees?**\
Certainly! While grapes are my specialty, Iâ€™m happy to prune any other fruit trees including apples, pears, peaches, etc.

**Why grapes?**\
I just love them! And I deeply believe in supporting our community in growing our own food in our soil as much as possible. While much of the city soil contains lead, woody plants including grapes do not uptake lead into their fruit, making urban fruit an important and safe local food source.
