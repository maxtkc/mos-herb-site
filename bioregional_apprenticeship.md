**Learn to follow the seasons as an herbalist!** In this apprenticeship program we will integrate our bodies with the bodies of the land and learn what plant medicine can look like on seven acres in New England. **We will follow the whole path of herbal medicine from seed, to harvest, to jar, to body.**

We’ll learn from and work with three main areas of the farm: the woodland edges, weeds in the fields, and the herb garden we’ll tend.

#### Daily flow:
Each month we’ll start by walking the land, baskets in hand. We’ll take note of the plants that are thriving and those that need extra care. We’ll harvest those that are abundant and at their peak and bring them back to our medicine-making house where we’ll process them and infuse them in oil, vinegar, alcohol, honey, and more.

As we scrub roots and strip leaves we’ll learn all about the medicine of the plants we are working with. Who is this plant, and how can we work with them? What is their chemistry, and what are their traditional uses? How are they best extracted? Who are they best for, and who would do better with other plants?

We will balance hands-on learning with lessons on the foundations of herbalism so that we can build a stronger understanding of the ways plants interact with bodies in general.
