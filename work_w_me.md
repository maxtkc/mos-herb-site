Schedule a free intro call above to learn what an herbal consulatation is all about and whether or not we might be a good fit for each other! For most people, this is your first time meeting with a clinical herbalist. We talk through what you're looking for and see if I might be able to support you.

None of the above times work? Send me a message at mkatzchristy (at) gmail.com with your availability, and I'll see what I'm able to do!

#### What does an herbal consult look like?

We meet for 1.5-2 hours for a thorough conversation in which I listen to your story and we try to uncover which patterns might be at the root of your symptoms. Afterwards, I'll do some research and then send you detailed recommendations including herbal formulas, dietary advice (optional!) and other guidance (blood tests, movement/massage, referrals to other practitioners). Once we settle on a protocol
that you feel excited about, I’ll send the formulas to an apothecary to be
filled, and you’ll receive your herbs in the mail.

#### How often do we check in?

![Picking Roses](/assets/images/roses.jpg){: style="float: left; width: 30%"}

As often as feels productive to you! Often, it is hard for us to track our own
process -- I have clients who forget they used to have headaches and are
very pleased when we meet and they realize that their headaches are gone! For
most people, I recommend meeting once every six weeks for at least three visits
and then every 3-6 months afterwards. However, some chronic issues can be like
onions -- once we peel one layer away we discover another layer to care for --
and can require more care and attention.

#### Appointment Pricing

I offer three tiers of pricing for consultations:
> Base Rate -- this is the price that pays me for my time
> Sustainer Rate -- when clients pay the sustainer rate, it directly funds free consultations for those who cannot afford my base rate.
> Free Rate -- if you cannot pay the base rate, you are eligible for a free consult when funds are available from clients paying the sustainer rate. Some clients are able to pay some amount but not the full base rate -- if so, that leaves some funds so that I’m able to see another client sooner, but there is never any pressure to do so.

The consultations are the same, regardless of the price!

#### Low-income herbal consults
I offer a limited number of $10 initial consultations and $5 follow-ups. These are available first come, first served, and are for clients who cannot afford my full prices. If you're interested in one of these sessions, please let me know during our intro call and I can tell you when the next one is available. I cannot offer sliding scale herbs since I don't use my own apothecary (see below).

#### Cost of herbs

Herbs can cost anywhere from \$50-\$200 per month. You are welcome to source
your herbs anywhere and I can support you in using foods and lower-cost remedies
to work within your budget. I primarily use [Heart Hand Lands apothecary](https://hearthandland.com/) for my
clients’ formulas because they source quality, sustainable, relatively
affordable herbs.
