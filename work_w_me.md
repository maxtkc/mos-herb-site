Schedule a free intro call above to learn what an herbal consulatation is all about and whether or not we might be a good fit for each other. For most people, this is your first time meeting with a clinical herbalist and it can be helpful to talk through what you're looking for and see if I might be able to support you.

#### What does an herbal consult look like?

We meet for 1.5-2 hours for a thorough conversation where we go through all of your
body systems and see which patterns might be at the root of the symptoms you are
experiencing. I spend ~2-3 hours afterwards researching and writing up
a thorough protocol for you, which I’ll send to you by email. Once we settle on a protocol
that you feel excited about, I’ll send the formulas to an apothecary to be
filled, and you’ll receive your herbs in the mail.

#### How often do we check in?

As often as feels productive to you! Often, it is hard for us to track our own
process -- I have clients who forget they used to have headaches and are
very pleased when we meet and they realize that their headaches are gone! For
most people, I recommend meeting once every six weeks for at least three visits
and then every 3-6 months afterwards. However, some chronic issues can be like
onions -- once we peel one layer away we discover another layer to care for --
and can require more care and attention.

#### Low-income herbal consults
I offer one $10 initial consultation and one $5 follow-up per month. These are available first come, first served, and are for clients who cannot afford my full prices. You can request one of these sessions by writing "$10/$5 consult" in the "notes" section of the scheduler above. I cannot offer sliding scale herbs since I don't use my own apothecary (see below).

#### Cost of herbs

Herbs can cost anywhere from \$50-\$200 per month. You are welcome to source
your herbs anywhere and I can support you in using foods and lower-cost remedies
to work within your budget. I primarily use [Heart Hand Lands apothecary](https://hearthandland.com/) for my
clients’ formulas because they source quality, sustainable, relatively
affordable herbs. I do not receive any income from the sale of herbs.
