### Past classes:


##### Medicine on the Seder Plate: Parlsey, Lettuce, Horseradish, and More!
> April 7th 1-2:30pm, [Abundance Farm](https://www.abundancefarm.org/)\
> April 14th 1-2:30pm, [Kavod Boston](https://www.kavodboston.org/)

Bitter herbs, spring greens -- these plants contain nutrients and flavors that are essential to our springtime bodies. In this class, we will explore the physiological wisdom in the plants we hold sacred. We will delve into the bitter flavor, as we discuss why neither horseradish nor lettuce -- the foods often included as “bitter herbs” on the seder plate -- are particularly bitter. We will learn about the vital importance of the bitter flavor for the functioning of our body systems, as well as the uses of the other flavors in these plants.

We will discuss how our body’s needs correspond with the seasons of the year, and how these differ by climate. What does your body crave in springtime, and how is (or isn’t) that reflected in our Jewish traditions? We will taste the plants on the seder plate and learn how these tastes interact with our bodies.

Join us for an herbal exploration into the plants of the seder plate!

Supported in part by a grant from the Harold Grinspoon Foundation.

##### Herbal Tincture-Making Workshop

> March 28th, 6-8pm, Union Square Culture House

Learn how to make an alcoholic herbal extract! Infusing herbs in alcohol is a great way to preserve them so that you have them readily on hand. And they last for years!

This workshop will teach the aspiring herbalist everything you need to know to make a high-quality tincture. We will go over each step of the process including sourcing herbs and alcohol, measuring the appropriate ratios, macerating the tincture, straining, and finally using your tincture.

Each participant will leave with a jar of herbal tincture and a cheesecloth to strain their tincture at home.

and dosage, and much much more.

Come each month to build your materia medica or just once to meet a new plant
friend!

##### Taste the Molecular Rainbow: What Color and Flavor Tell Us About Chemistry

> September 10 2023, 4-5:30pm, Somerville Community Growing Center

Why do all alliums have that strong garlicky smell? How do I know if the dried
herbs I've had in my cabinet for five years are still good? In this class you
will begin to practice using your senses to teach you about the chemical
constituents in your foods and medicine. We will discuss the primary atoms that
make up plant molecules, and some common forms that they take. You will get to
see, smell, and taste different preparations of the same herbs to learn the
flavors and mouthfeel of specific molecules, and to learn which preparations
extract which constituents. Bring your favorite mug and a pen and come join me
where experiential and scientific knowledge meet!
