#### Herbal Tincture Making Workshop

> March 28th, 6-8pm, Union Square Culture House

Learn how to make an alcoholic herbal extract! Infusing herbs in alcohol is a great way to preserve them so that you have them readily on hand. And they last for years!

This workshop will teach the aspiring herbalist everything you need to know to make a high-quality tincture. We will go over each step of the process including sourcing herbs and alcohol, measuring the appropriate ratios, macerating the tincture, straining, and finally using your tincture.

Each participant will leave with a jar of herbal tincture and a cheesecloth to strain their tincture at home.

science, and stories of herbalists’ experience. Bring your journal and leave
with an in-depth account of botany, history, clinical use, safety, preparation
and dosage, and much much more.

Come each month to build your materia medica or just once to meet a new plant
friend!

##### Taste the Molecular Rainbow: What Color and Flavor Tell Us About Chemistry

> September 10 2023, 4-5:30pm, Somerville Community Growing Center

Why do all alliums have that strong garlicky smell? How do I know if the dried
herbs I've had in my cabinet for five years are still good? In this class you
will begin to practice using your senses to teach you about the chemical
constituents in your foods and medicine. We will discuss the primary atoms that
make up plant molecules, and some common forms that they take. You will get to
see, smell, and taste different preparations of the same herbs to learn the
flavors and mouthfeel of specific molecules, and to learn which preparations
extract which constituents. Bring your favorite mug and a pen and come join me
where experiential and scientific knowledge meet!
