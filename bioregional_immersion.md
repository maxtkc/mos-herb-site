**Learn to follow the seasons as an herbalist!** In this immersive program we will integrate our bodies with the bodies of the land and learn what plant medicine can look like on seven acres in New England. **We will follow the whole path of herbal medicine from seed, to harvest, to jar, to body.**

We’ll learn from and work with three main areas of the farm: the woodland edges, weeds in the fields, and the herb garden we’ll tend. **Each month we'll make herbal preparations to bring home and share with our communities!**

### Quick info:
> Where: Waltham Fields Community Farm\
> When: One Sunday per month, 11am-5pm with a lunch break (10am-4pm in fall for daylight)\
> Who: Herbal enthusiasts wanting to get your hands dirty!

#### Daily flow:
Each month we’ll start by walking the land, baskets in hand. We’ll take note of the plants that are thriving and those that need extra care. We’ll harvest those that are abundant and at their peak and bring them back to our medicine-making house where we’ll process them and infuse them in oil, vinegar, alcohol, honey, and more.

As we scrub roots and strip leaves we’ll learn all about the medicine of the plants we are working with. Who is this plant, and how can we work with them? What is their chemistry, and what are their traditional uses? How are they best extracted? Who are they best for, and who would do better with other plants?

We will balance hands-on learning with lessons on the foundations of herbalism so that we can build a stronger understanding of the ways plants interact with bodies in general.

### FAQ

**Can I join even if I have no formal herbal training?**
Yes! This program is for herb enthusiasts who are in the beginning of their herbal journey. Maybe you've taken a couple of classes or made some medicine on your own, or maybe you are completely green and ready to dive in!

**What if I have to miss one of the Sundays?**
No problem! Since this is an in-person program we won't be recording the sessions, but I'll send you the handouts and your classmates can share their notes. You may be able to go to the farm and harvest herbs to make medicine on your own time. That said, if you know you'll need to miss more than 2-3 classes, it may not be the best fit.

**Will there be a lunch break?**
Yes! I recommend you bring a lunch since there aren't a ton of close by options, but there are a few. We'll have at least one potluck as well!

**What if I don't have a car?**
I don't either! Waltham Fields Community Farm is a 30 minute walk from the Waverly Commuter Rail station and easily accessible by bicycle.
