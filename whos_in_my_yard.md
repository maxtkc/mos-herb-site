Are you curious? Maybe we've been on a plant walk together and you're wondering who's growing in your back yard or in a park near you. Maybe you are an avid gardener and you want to learn about the medicinal uses of the plants you grow. Book a personalized plant walk with me to get to know the medicine around you and how you can connect with it.

I also offer plant paddles! Instead of walking, we paddle around an area of your choosing and I introduce you to the plants on the riverbanks. You supply the kayaks/canoes (your own or from a rental company).

Book below if you live or want to walk/paddle less than 8 miles from Davis Square, and if the times available work for you:

[Fill out this interest form](https://forms.gle/CGNbV5D1ft5PLqGW8) if you live or want to walk/paddle further than 8 miles from Davis Square, OR if the times available don’t work for you. We’ll find a time that works for both of us!

#### FAQ:

##### Can I bring someone else?
Yes! You can bring up to 4 people (including you), or more for an additional fee.

##### I don’t have a yard, but still want a personalized plant walk. Can you plan a walk for me?
Yes! Tell me what your goals are, and we’ll find a place that can meet them.

##### Will you know every plant in my yard?
Certainly not! I specialize in wild and invasive plants and weeds, so the more cultivated your yard is with exotic cultivars, the less likely I will be to know them all. However, I can show you how to ID unfamiliar plants and what we can know about their medicinal uses by knowing their relatives.

##### Do you travel?
Yes, within reason! As long as you are within 30 miles of a bus or train station, I can get to you. There may be an added fee.

##### Do you do family reunions, anniversary gifts, or birthday parties?
Yes, yes, and yes. Surprise your beloved with a magical walk through their favorite park, gather your family to learn about the plants around your generational home…the possibilities are endless.

##### Why are your times all weekday daytimes?
I teach and see clients many evenings and Sundays, so I have limited availability outside of 9-5. However, fill out the interest form and we’ll find a time that works for us!

#### Pricing:
Within 8 miles of Davis Square, within my available times: $150

Outside of my region or my available times: $200+
