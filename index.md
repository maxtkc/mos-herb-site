Want to address the root imbalances that are leading to dysregulation in your body systems?

I can partner with you to understand your body from an herbal perspective – one that integrates scientific research with traditional botanical uses – in order to promote long-term healing.

While my practice centers gut health, I follow my clients' lead and we work on what is showing up. I have experience supporting clients with:

- diabetes
- thyroid imbalances and fatigue
- sleep issues
- depression and anxiety
- migraines
- GI dysregulation - IBS, diverticulitis, constipation, etc.
- gender-affirming hormone therapy
- immune support
- allergies and asthma
- skin issues
- and much, much more!

> When I first considered seeing Mo, I thought: "do I really need an
herbalist?” I know now what a silly question it was! **If you eat food, you
need an herbalist!** Mo has thoughtfully explained how herbs can support me,
and has empowered me to be an active participant in my general healthcare, and
to learn more about plants and our relationship to nature. **I feel so supported! Mo meets you where you are, with no
judgement, only kind consideration.** If you’re on the fence, do it!
