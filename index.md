Want to work to shift the root patterns that are causing your symptoms, without increasing your medications?

I can help you advocate for yourself in a conventional setting as well as give you the tools to understand your body from an herbal perspective -- one that integrates modern scientific research with centuries of tradition of botanical uses.

I have experience supporting clients with:

- diabetes
- Hashimotoâ€™s thyroiditis and fatigue
- sleep issues
- depression and anxiety
- migraines
- GI dysregulation - diverticulitis, constipation, etc.
- gender-affirming hormone therapy
- immune support
- allergies and asthma
- skin issues, inc. MRSA infections and wound healing and much, much more!
