Want to work to shift the root patterns that are causing your symptoms, without increasing your medications?

I can help you advocate for yourself in a conventional setting as well as give you the tools to understand your body from an herbal perspective -- one that integrates modern scientific research with centuries of tradition of botanical uses.

I have experience supporting clients with:

- diabetes
- Hashimoto’s thyroiditis and fatigue
- sleep issues
- depression and anxiety
- migraines
- GI dysregulation - diverticulitis, constipation, etc.
- gender-affirming hormone therapy
- immune support
- allergies and asthma
- skin issues, inc. MRSA infections and wound healing and much, much more!

> When I first considered seeing Mo, I thought: "do I really need an
herbalist?” I know now what a silly question it was! If you eat food, you need
an herbalist! Mo has thoughtfully explained how herbs can support me, and has
empowered me to be an active participant in my general healthcare, and to learn
more about plants and our relationship to nature. Immune support with young
kids has been so important, and support through winter during breastfeeding has
helped me immensely in knowing I’m doing the right thing for my body and
infant. Mo has recommended several books on herbs and growing my own herbs.
I feel so supported! Mo meets you where you are, with no judgement, only kind
consideration. If you’re on the fence, do it!
