#### Medicine Making
{% capture tea %}

Anyone can make a delicious herbal tea blend! In this class, we will discuss a handful of common herbs for tea: their uses, flavors, energies, and what they add to a blend. We will smell each of the herbs and taste some as well, learning how the flavors blend and how they complement each other.

We will discuss different considerations for the process of making tea including infusing versus boiling, temperature of the water, and length of time infused.

Part information and science, part sensory exploration, this class will be as playful as it is educational!

Food is medicine! And medicine can taste delicious.

Did you know that we have far more bitter taste receptors than any other, and when we taste something bitter our whole body reacts? Or that aromatic molecules ease gut spasms by irritating our smooth muscles so that they contract and then relax?

Come deepen your understanding of how flavor shows up physiologically in our bodies! In this class, we will learn how to use common kitchen spices to promote circulation, ease gut spasms, modulate blood sugar and more!

After we’ve fully nerded out on chemistry, Mo will guide the class in making our own medicinal spice blends!  Each participant will have the opportunity to make their own individualized blend to take home for their household or to gift to someone they love. Part science, part play, this class is for anyone who knows that cooking is the best way to care for our communities.

No matter how dark and tiny your apartment is, you can grow herbs! Herb gardens are stellar for urban spaces because herbs thrive in a wide variety of ecological niches. We will focus on herbs for gut health, stress regulation and sleep, and immune support. We will discuss herbs you can bring inside for the winter, herbs that you can grow in lead soil, and herbs that can handle neglect. Leave with the information to grow, tend, harvest, and use herbs that you grow here in Boston!

Learn how to make an alcoholic herbal extract! Infusing herbs in alcohol is a great way to preserve them so that you have them readily on hand. And they last for years!

This workshop will teach the aspiring herbalist everything you need to know to make a high-quality tincture. We will go over each step of the process including sourcing herbs and alcohol, measuring the appropriate ratios, macerating the tincture, straining, and finally using your tincture.

Each participant will leave with a jar of herbal tincture and a cheesecloth to strain their tincture at home.

The sweetness of honey combined with the flavorful tartness of medicinal berries…come learn how to make an herbal syrup! In this class, we will discuss what herbal syrups are, what they are used for, and how to make one.

From the immune activity of elderberry syrup to the nourishment of an iron syrup, herbal syrups are certainly delicious and nutritious. We will learn how to make a syrup shelf-stable as well as methods of preserving or prolonging the life of perishable syrups.

Finally, we will make one ourselves! We will mix medicinal berries and honey to make a delicious immune and heart support syrup. We will learn about each of these plants (+ honey) and how they each contribute to the medicine of the syrup. Each participant will get a small jar to take home and share with their family and community. Come prepared to enjoy the sticky sweetness of herbal syrup!
