#### Medicine Making
{% capture tea %}

Anyone can make a delicious herbal tea blend! In this class, we will discuss a handful of common herbs for tea: their uses, flavors, energies, and what they add to a blend. We will smell each of the herbs and taste some as well, learning how the flavors blend and how they complement each other.

We will discuss different considerations for the process of making tea including infusing versus boiling, temperature of the water, and length of time infused.

Part information and science, part sensory exploration, this class will be as playful as it is educational!

{% capture spice %}
Food is medicine! And medicine can taste delicious.

Did you know that we have far more bitter taste receptors than any other, and when we taste something bitter our whole body reacts? Or that aromatic molecules ease gut spasms by irritating our smooth muscles so that they contract and then relax?

Come deepen your understanding of how flavor shows up physiologically in our bodies! In this class, we will learn how to use common kitchen spices to promote circulation, ease gut spasms, modulate blood sugar and more!

After weâ€™ve fully nerded out on chemistry, Mo will guide the class in making our own medicinal spice blends!  Each participant will have the opportunity to make their own individualized blend to take home for their household or to gift to someone they love. Part science, part play, this class is for anyone who knows that cooking is the best way to care for our communities.
