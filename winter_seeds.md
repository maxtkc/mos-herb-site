**Calling all aspiring herbalists!** Spend these cold months cozy with a cup of tea in Constellation studio diving deep into the foundations of herbalism with a cohort of dedicated plant people.

#### Daily flow:
Each week we’ll focus on a different body system and the ways that we can work with herbs to address common concerns. We’ll learn how to make **1-2 herbal preparations** that help to regulate and heal our body system of the week. In the afternoon, we’ll have a second herbal lesson to help us put the **physiology into practice!**


#### In March, you’ll leave with:
- a **mini-apothecary** of remedies to share with your loved ones
- foundations of understanding of **six body systems** and the ways plants interact with them
- strong familiarity with **21 herbal allies**
